## 💡 Architecture Notes

### Current Stack
- **Frontend:** React 18, TypeScript, Vite
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components
- **State:** React Context API
- **Backend:** Firestore + Firebase Auth
- **Routing:** React Router v6
- **Validation:** Zod schemas
- **Testing:** Vitest (unit), Playwright (E2E)
